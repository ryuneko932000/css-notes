<!-- Remember that CSS reads from top to bottom,
meaning that in this case the .header would
output a color blue rather than red. However if
we use a type for our selector, the color would
still be blue, as classes have a higher specificity
than types. The same goes for IDs, IDs have a 
higher specificity than any other types of 
selectors. Meaning IDs > Classes > Types -->

<!-- In the case of our h2 tag, the IDs wins over 
the class selector, meaning that the output is black
rather than blue. The highest specificity is the 
actual tag properties meaning: <p color="red"> is
the highest you can go.-->

<!-- We can also combine specifities, meaning that we can combine
a h1 selector with a class. Something like this: h1.class
This would output a higher specificity than a simple class.-->
