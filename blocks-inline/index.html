    <h1> Blocks & Inlines</h1>
    <div class="main-div"> 

        <p> Remember that blocks stack on eachother, meaning
            that a new line is made when making a new block. 
            Normally speaking they take up all of the horizontal
            space. In this case the width is just as is, nothing was
            modified. </p>

        <p class="block-small"> This is another block, it has been modfied so as to make
            the width a bit smaller.  </p>

        <p class="block-smaller"> As you can see this block is even smaller. Because this is a 
            block element it stays on the line and doesn't automatically go up to fill up the left over 
            space on the upper side. Blocks always start on a new line. </p>

        <p class="blockInline"> This is another paragraph block which in theory should work as one. But we added 
            some more attributes inside our css style file. </p>

        <p class="blockInline"> However because we stated that this is a inline block, they do in fact take
            the space next to eachother. No more block stacking here.</p>

        <a href="" class="btn">I'm an inline block button</a>
        <a href="" class="btn">I'm another button</a>

        <p> Blocks can also include inline elements, again inline elements take up the space accordingly.
            Say we call a <strong class="strong1"> strong tag </strong> and we modify it a bit. With inlin
            elements, attributes like width or height do not affect the end result. </p>
