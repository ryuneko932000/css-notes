<!-- Here I'll be trying to understand how chain selectors work.-->

<!-- According to the TOP website, we can group up certain
qualities that are shared amongst other classes/IDs/types. 
The following can be done.--> 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>CSS Grouping Selectors Example </title>
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: black;
        }
        .text1,.text2{
            font-size: 3em;
            font-weight: 300;
        }
        .text1{
            color: red;
        }
        .text2{
            color: orange;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="text1">THE LÄND SUCKS </div>
    <div class="text2"> MEXICO IS WAY BETTER</div>
    
</body>
</html>

<!-- What happens in here? Basically we can add properties that affect both text1 and text2, meaning they share 
some of these properties. We can still single out text1 and text2 and adding their own custom effects. -->
